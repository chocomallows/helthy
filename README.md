# -- Helthy README -- 

*Made by Arne*

## -- The why --

This README was made to offer an overview of our product, as well as the process that got us to our end-result.
We were given the assignment to make a website from stratch, the topic being a fictitious company.
The time given for this assignment was a week, in which we had to:

* Decide on our topic
* Decide our plan of attack
    * How do we organise ourselves?
    * Who does what?
    * What deadlines do we give ourselves?
    * What IDE does everyone use?
* Hit those deadlines!

## -- The what --

### -- The topic --
This repo is the process as well as the final product of our group project. For our ficticious company, we decided on the concept of a Dietician Practice, as it lined up wel with one of our group member's current occupation. For the others, it was an interesting way to learn more about health and nutrition and it also allowed us to dive deeper into specific themes and styles appropriate to health, wellness and nature, rather than the more popular tech-subjects.

### -- The name --
We quickly came up with the name "Helthy", simple, short and concise, as well as directly linked to the philosophy and goal of our fictitious company. "Helthy" as a name allows for easy creation of a customised logo, as well as being not being intrustive and too long.

### -- The repo --
In this repository you will find all the building blocks needed to recreate the website and preview it yourself. It contains this README as well as all the HTML, CSS and JS files, together with images and icons.

## -- The Previews --

In this section, we'll give you a quick preview of every page that was created.

Here is a preview of the homepage:
