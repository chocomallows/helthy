# -- Helthy README -- 

*Made by Arne*

## -- The why --

This README was made to offer an overview of our product, as well as the process that got us to our end-result.
We were given the assignment to make a website from stratch, the topic being a fictitious company.
The time given for this assignment was a week, in which we had to:

    * Decide on our topic
    * Decide our plan of attack
        * How do we organise ourselves?
        * Who does what?
        * What deadlines do we give ourselves?
        * What IDE does everyone use?
    * Hit those deadlines!

## -- The what --

This repo is the process as well as the final product of our group project.
